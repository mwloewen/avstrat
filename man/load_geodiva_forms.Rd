\title{Load stratigraphic data from GeoDIVA upload forms}
\usage{
load_geodiva_forms(station_sample_upload, layer_upload)
}
\arguments{
\item{station_sample_upload}{data frame created from uploaded GeoDIVA format
Station/Sample upload sheet, usually uploaded with \code{readxl::read_xlsx()}
linked to filepath.}

\item{layer_upload}{data frame created from uploaded GeoDIVA format
Layers upload sheet, usually uploaded with \code{readxl::read_xlsx()}
linked to filepath.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the merged and cleaned stratigraphic
data, ready for further analysis.
}
\description{
\code{load_geodiva_forms()} processes and cleans stratigraphic data from GeoDIVA
upload forms, specifically a form that includes Station and Sample data and
another form that includes the Layer data. It merges these datasets,
resolves any conflicts in key fields, and prepares a consolidated dataset
for further analysis. The function also extracts and prints a list of unique
stratigraphic sections.
