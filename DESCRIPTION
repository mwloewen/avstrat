Description: Data processing and generating stratigraphic sections 
    for volcanic deposits and tephrastratigraphy. Package was developed for
    studies on Alaska volcanoes ("av") where stratigraphic ("strat") figures 
    are needed for interpreting eruptive histories, but the methods are applicable
    to any sediment stratigraphy project. Plotting styles inspired by "SedLog"
    (Zervas et al. 2009) <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2009.02.009> but with 
    more customizable outputs and flexible data input based on best practice
    recommendations for the tephra community (Wallace et al. 2022) 
    <doi:10.1038/s41597-022-01515-y>.
